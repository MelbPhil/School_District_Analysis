# School_District_Analysis
Analyzing standardized testing trends (_using Python and Jupyter Notebook_)

### Overview of School District Analysis
I assisted the chief data scientist for a city school district in analysing the results of student standardized test scores, and how those results coorelated with various factors, such as school size, amount of funding, type of school, etc. After learning that a specific subcategory of the dataset may have been altered (_specifically, the reading and math scores for Thomas High School_), I reran the complete analysis process, after first replacing all allegedly tempered data with NaN's (_Not A Number_). The following summary reviews how the removal of both math and reading scores from Thomas High School ninth graders impacted the overall findings from analyzing the city school district's standardized testing data.
